## Summary
Enable additional clippy lints to improve code quality and maintain consistent coding standards across the codebase.

## Tasks
- Enable stricter clippy lint groups (e.g., `clippy::pedantic`, `clippy::nursery`)
- Configure project-specific lint rules in `Cargo.toml` or `clippy.toml`
- Review and selectively allow/deny specific lints based on project needs
- Update CI to enforce the new lint configuration
- Fix any new warnings introduced by the additional lints

## Motivation
Stricter clippy lints help catch potential bugs, improve code maintainability, and enforce best practices consistently across the codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Additional clippy lints are configured at the workspace level
- CI fails on new clippy warnings
- Existing codebase passes all enabled lints
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new lint configuration
