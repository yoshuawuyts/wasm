# This workflow automates the release process using release-plz.
#
# How it works:
# 1. When code is pushed to main, the "release-pr" job creates or updates a release PR
#    with changelogs and version bumps based on conventional commits.
# 2. When a release PR is merged (detected by release-plz commit message pattern),
#    the "release" job publishes the crates to crates.io and creates GitHub releases.
