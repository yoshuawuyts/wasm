# Tracey Specification

## Introduction

Tracey maintains traceability between specifications and code. Specs, implementations, and tests drift apart—code changes without updating specs, specs describe unimplemented features, tests cover different scenarios than requirements specify.

Tracey uses lightweight annotations in markdown and source code comments to link specification requirements with implementing code, tests, and dependencies. This enables:

- Verifying multiple implementations (different languages, platforms) match the same spec
- Finding which requirements lack implementation or tests
- Seeing which requirement justifies each piece of code
- Analyzing impact when requirements or code changes

This document has two parts: **Language** (annotation syntax) and **Tooling** (tracey implementation).

## Nomenclature

To avoid confusion, we define these terms precisely and use them consistently:

**Specification** (or **spec**)
A set of requirements, typically written as a human-readable document.

**Requirement** (or **req**)
A single, positive (MUST, not MUST NOT) property of the system that is both implementable and testable. Each requirement should describe one specific behavior or constraint.

**Implementation**
Code that fulfills a requirement's behavior or constraint.

**Test**
Code that verifies an implementation correctly fulfills a requirement, typically containing assertions run by a test harness.

**Important distinctions:**
- A **spec** is a document containing requirements. **Tests** are executable code. Don't use "spec" to mean "test file" (as some test frameworks do).
- Other projects may use "rule" to mean requirement. We don't use that term—use "requirement" or "req" instead.

---

# Language

This section specifies the annotation language: how to define requirements in markdown specifications and reference them in source code.

## Requirement Definitions in Markdown

Requirements are defined in markdown specification documents using the syntax `PREFIX[REQ]` where PREFIX is the spec's configured prefix and REQ is a requirement ID.

### Markdown Requirement Syntax

> r[markdown.syntax.marker]
> A requirement definition MUST be written as `PREFIX[REQ]` in one of two contexts: as a standalone paragraph starting at column 0, or inside a blockquote. The PREFIX identifies which spec this requirement belongs to (configured via `prefix` in the spec configuration). The VERB is implicitly "define" in markdown (unlike source code which uses explicit verbs like `r[impl REQ]`).
>
> Valid (standalone):
> ```markdown
> r[auth.token.validation]
> The system must validate tokens before granting access.
> ```
>
> Valid (in blockquote for multi-paragraph content):
> ```markdown
> > r[api.error.format]
> > API errors must follow this format:
> >
> > ```json
> > {"error": "message", "code": 400}
> > ```
> ```

> r[markdown.syntax.inline-ignored]
> Requirement markers that appear inline within other text MUST be treated as regular text, not requirement definitions.
>
> Valid (defines requirement):
> ```markdown
> r[database.connection]
> When connecting to the database...
> ```
>
> Invalid (treated as text, not a definition):
> ```markdown
> When implementing r[database.connection] you should...
> ```

### Duplicate Detection

> r[markdown.duplicates.same-file]
> If the same requirement ID appears multiple times in a single markdown file, an error MUST be reported.
>
> Invalid:
> ```markdown
> r[auth.validation]
> Users must authenticate.
>
> Later in the same file...
>
> r[auth.validation]
> This causes an error - duplicate requirement ID!
> ```

> r[markdown.duplicates.cross-file]
> If the same requirement ID appears in multiple markdown files within the same spec, an error MUST be reported when merging manifests. Requirement IDs only need to be unique within a single spec; different specs may use the same requirement ID since they have different prefixes.
>
> Invalid (same spec):
> ```markdown
> # docs/spec/auth.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> API responses must use JSON.
>
> # docs/spec/api.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> Error - this requirement ID is already defined in auth.md within the same spec!
> ```
>
> Valid (different specs):
> ```markdown
> # docs/tracey/spec.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> API responses must use JSON.
>
> # vendor/messaging-spec/spec.md (messaging spec, prefix "m")
> m[api.format]
> OK - different spec, different prefix, no conflict.
> ```

## Requirement References in Source Code

Requirement references are extracted from source code comments using the syntax `PREFIX[VERB REQ]` where PREFIX matches a configured spec's prefix.

### Basic Syntax

r[ref.syntax.brackets]
A requirement reference MUST be written as `PREFIX[VERB REQ]` within a comment, where PREFIX identifies which spec is being referenced (matching the `prefix` field in the spec configuration).

> r[ref.syntax.verb]
> VERB indicates the relationship type (impl, verify, depends, related).
> 
> If omitted, defaults to `impl`.

> r[ref.syntax.req-id]
> REQ is a requirement ID consisting of dot-separated segments.
>
> Each segment MUST contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens, or underscores. This restriction ensures requirement IDs work cleanly in URLs without encoding issues.

> r[ref.syntax.surrounding-text]
> The annotation MAY be surrounded by other text within the comment. Any characters (including punctuation) after the closing `]` are ignored by the parser.
>
> Valid:
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth.token.validation]       // tracey spec (prefix "r")
> // r[verify user-profile.update_email] // tracey spec
> // m[depends crypto_v2.algorithm]      // messaging spec (prefix "m")
> // h2[impl api.v1.users]               // http2 spec (prefix "h2")
> // r[message.hello.timing]: send Hello immediately
> // See r[auth.requirements] for details.
> ```
>
> Invalid:
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth..token]           // empty segment
> // r[verify user.profile!update] // exclamation mark not allowed
> // r[depends .crypto.algorithm]  // leading dot
> // r[impl api.users.]            // trailing dot
> // r[verify user profile.update] // space not allowed
> // r[impl auth.🔐.token]         // emoji not allowed
> // r[verify café.menu]           // accented characters not allowed
> ```

### Supported Verbs

Source code references use verbs to indicate the relationship between code and requirements:

> r[ref.verb.impl]
> The `impl` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating that the code implements the referenced requirement.
>
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth.token.validation]
> fn validate_token(token: &str) -> bool {
>     // etc.
> }
> ```

> r[ref.verb.verify]
> The `verify` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating that the code tests or verifies the referenced requirement.
>
> ```typescript
> test('token validation', () => {
>     // r[verify auth.token.validation]
>     expect(validateToken('abc')).toBe(true);
> });
> ```

> r[ref.verb.depends]
> The `depends` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating a strict dependency — the code must be rechecked if the referenced requirement changes.
>
> ```python
> # r[depends auth.crypto.algorithm]
> # This code must be reviewed if the crypto algorithm changes
> def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
>     return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
> ```

> r[ref.verb.related]
> The `related` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating a loose connection, shown when reviewing related code.
>
> ```swift
> // r[related user.session.timeout]
> // Session cleanup is related to timeout requirements
> func cleanupExpiredSessions() {
>     sessions.removeAll { $0.isExpired }
> }
> ```

> r[ref.verb.default]
> When no verb is provided, the reference SHOULD be treated as an `impl` reference.
>
> ```go
> // r[auth.token.validation] - no verb, defaults to 'impl'
> func ValidateToken(token string) bool {
>     return len(token) > 0
> }
> ```

### Comment Types

r[ref.comments.line]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in line comments (`//`, `#`, etc. depending on language).

r[ref.comments.block]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in block comments (`/* */`, `""" """`, etc. depending on language).

r[ref.comments.doc]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in documentation comments (`///`, `//!`, `/** */`, etc. depending on language).

### Source Location Tracking

r[ref.span.offset]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the byte offset of its location in the source file.

r[ref.span.length]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the byte length of the reference.

r[ref.span.file]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the path to the source file.

---

# Tooling

This section specifies how the tracey tool processes annotations, computes coverage, and exposes results.

## Coverage Computation

r[coverage.compute.percentage]
Coverage percentage MUST be calculated as (covered requirements / total requirements) * 100.

r[coverage.compute.covered]
Tracey MUST consider a requirement covered if at least one reference to it exists in the scanned source files.

r[coverage.compute.uncovered]
Requirements in the manifest with no references MUST be reported as uncovered.

r[coverage.compute.invalid]
References to requirement IDs not present in the manifest MUST be reported as invalid.

## Reference Extraction

r[ref.verb.unknown]
When an unrecognized verb is encountered, tracey MUST emit a warning but SHOULD still extract the requirement reference.

r[ref.prefix.unknown]
When a reference uses a prefix that does not match any configured spec, tracey MUST report an error indicating the unknown prefix and list the available spec prefixes.

r[ref.prefix.matching]
When extracting references from source code, tracey MUST match the prefix against configured specs to determine which spec's requirement namespace to query.

## Markdown Processing

### HTML Output

> r[markdown.html.div]
> When transforming markdown, each requirement marker MUST be replaced with a `<div>` element with class `requirement`.
>
> Input:
> ```markdown
> r[auth.token.validation]
> ```
>
> Output:
> ```html
> <div class="requirement" id="r-auth.token.validation">
>   <a href="#r-auth.token.validation">auth.<wbr>token.<wbr>validation</a>
> </div>
> ```

> r[markdown.html.anchor]
> The generated div MUST have an `id` attribute in the format `r-{req.id}` for linking.
>
> ```html
> <div class="requirement" id="r-api.response.format">
> ```

> r[markdown.html.link]
> The generated div MUST contain a link (`<a>`) pointing to its own anchor.
>
> ```html
> <a href="#r-user.login.flow">user.<wbr>login.<wbr>flow</a>
> ```

> r[markdown.html.wbr]
> Dots in the displayed requirement ID SHOULD be followed by `<wbr>` elements to allow line breaking.
>
> ```html
> database.<wbr>connection.<wbr>pool
> ```

## Configuration

r[config.format.kdl]
The configuration file MUST be in KDL format.

r[config.path.default]
The default configuration path MUST be `.config/tracey/config.kdl` relative to the project root.

> r[config.schema]
> The configuration MUST follow this schema:
>
> ```kdl
> spec {
>     name "tracey"
>     prefix "r"
>     include "docs/spec/**/*.md"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/**/*.rs"
>         exclude "target/**"
>     }
> }
>
> spec {
>     name "messaging-protocol"
>     prefix "m"
>     include "vendor/messaging-spec/**/*.md"
>     source_url "https://github.com/example/messaging-spec"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/**/*.rs"
>     }
> }
> ```

r[config.spec.name]
Each spec configuration MUST have a `name` child node with the spec name as its argument.

r[config.spec.prefix]
Each spec configuration MUST have a `prefix` child node specifying the single-character or multi-character prefix used to identify this spec in markdown and source code annotations.

r[config.spec.include]
Each spec configuration MUST have one or more `include` child nodes specifying glob patterns for markdown files containing requirement definitions.

r[config.spec.source-url]
Each spec configuration MAY have a `source_url` child node providing the canonical URL for the specification (e.g., a GitHub repository). This URL is used for attribution in the dashboard and documentation.

r[config.impl.name]
Each impl configuration MUST have a `name` child node identifying the implementation (e.g., "main", "core").

r[config.impl.include]
Each impl configuration MAY have one or more `include` child nodes specifying glob patterns for source files to scan.

r[config.impl.exclude]
Each impl configuration MAY have one or more `exclude` child nodes specifying glob patterns for source files to exclude.

### Multiple Specs and Remote Specs

r[config.multi-spec.prefix-namespace]
When multiple specs are configured, the prefix serves as the namespace to disambiguate which spec a requirement belongs to.

r[config.multi-spec.unique-within-spec]
Requirement IDs MUST be unique within a single spec, but MAY be duplicated across different specs (since they use different prefixes).

r[config.remote-spec.local-files]
Remote specifications MUST be obtained as local files before tracey can process them. Users can use git submodules, manual downloads, or any other method to obtain spec files locally.

> r[config.remote-spec.workflow]
> The recommended workflow for implementing a remote specification is:
>
> 1. Obtain the spec files locally (e.g., via git submodule or download)
> 2. Configure the spec with `include` pointing to the local files
> 3. Set `source_url` to the canonical spec location for attribution
> 4. Use the spec's configured prefix in source code annotations
>
> Example:
> ```kdl
> spec {
>     name "http2"
>     prefix "h2"
>     include "vendor/http2-spec/docs/**/*.md"
>     source_url "https://github.com/http2/spec"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/http2/**/*.rs"
>     }
> }
> ```

## File Walking

r[walk.gitignore]
File walking MUST respect `.gitignore` files.
